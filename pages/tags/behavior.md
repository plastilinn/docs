## 🦾 behavior

### Definition 
"behavior" refers to what customers express (say) and their observable actions (do) during their experience with a product or service. In an Empathy Map, this section captures both the verbal feedback provided by customers—such as comments, quotes, and reviews—and their actual behaviors or interactions. Understanding the "behavior" aspect helps businesses identify inconsistencies between what customers claim and how they actually behave, providing valuable insights into customer expectations, preferences, and pain points that can be addressed to enhance the overall experience.
