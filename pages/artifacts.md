### Instruction Manual for Tagging Business Plan Elements

This manual provides guidelines for structuring your business plan document using a tagging system, where each section is tagged with a specific identifier. These tags allow the system to recognize and display the information for each element in various business artifacts, including the Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Canvas, Empathy Map, and Customer Journey Map.

#### General Instructions

1. **Tag Structure**: Use specific tags for each section's elements. Each tag should reflect the purpose of the content (e.g., `👥#partner` for key partners).  
     
2. **Tag Format**: Tags should be in the format `emoji#tag-name`, where the **emoji** visually identifies the category, and the **tag-name** is descriptive and relevant to the content.  
     
3. **Tag Location**: Place the tags directly within each section in your business plan document. This ensures the system can recognize and extract the specific information for each artifact.

  #### Implementation Steps

1. **Content Tagging**: Ensure each section and element in your business plan document is correctly tagged as specified above.  
2. **Content Verification**: After tagging, verify that all sections you want to display in each artifact are correctly tagged with exact emojis and tag names.  
3. **Updating Sections**: To update content, adjust the text of each tag within the source document.

   Each artifact should display information tagged in the document under its respective sections, ensuring that all content aligns with the designated tags.
