## 📖 Description
the concept of "segment" or "segmentation criteria" refers to the process of dividing a company's market into distinct groups of buyers who might require separate products or marketing mixes. These groups, or segments, are defined by shared characteristics such as demographics, behaviors, needs, or preferences. The purpose of segmentation is to allow a company to better tailor its products, services, and marketing efforts to meet the specific needs of different customer groups.

Segmentation criteria can be based on a wide range of factors, including age, gender, income, location, lifestyle, buying behavior, and more. The chosen criteria should be relevant to the product or service being offered, and should effectively differentiate different groups of customers.

For example, a clothing retailer might segment its market based on age and gender, offering different product lines for men, women, and children. Within these broad segments, the retailer might further segment based on factors like fashion style or price sensitivity, offering different ranges for customers who prefer tagic versus trendy styles, or budget versus premium pricing.

In essence, the concept of "segment" or "segmentation criteria" in business modeling is about understanding and categorizing the diverse needs and preferences of a company's customer base. This allows the company to more effectively target its offerings and marketing efforts, improving customer satisfaction and business performance. It is a critical element in business design, shaping the development of a company's products, services, and marketing strategies.

## 👉 Example (SpaceX)

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 10px;">✂️#segmentation Organization size (small, medium, large)

✂️#segmentation Organization revenue levels ( < 500M, >500M)

✂️#segmentation geographic location (regions or countries, orbits, particular launch sites)

✂️#segmentation industry (telecommunications, defense, scientific research, etc.)

## 🔑 Keys



## 🧰 Tools
**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, "customer segments" are one of the nine key components. This refers to the different groups of people or organizations an enterprise aims to reach and serve. Companies are advised to group customers into distinct segments based on common needs, behaviors, or other attributes.
**Value Proposition Canvas**
This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is a supplement to the Business Model Canvas. It helps businesses understand their customer segments in more depth, by mapping customer needs, gains, and pains. This can help in identifying and defining distinct customer segments.
**STP (Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning)**
This is a tagic marketing model that starts with market segmentation. It involves dividing the market into distinct groups of customers with similar needs or characteristics. The company then selects which segments to target and defines how it will position its offerings to each target segment.
**Persona Development**
This tool involves creating detailed profiles of fictional customers who represent different segments. These personas are based on customer research and can help businesses understand and empathize with the needs of different customer segments.
**Market Segmentation Matrix**
This tool helps businesses visualize and understand their market segments. It involves plotting different segments on a matrix based on two key variables, such as size and growth potential. This can help businesses identify which segments are most attractive.
**RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis**
This is a quantitative tool used in customer segmentation. It involves analyzing customer behavior based on three factors: how recently they made a purchase (recency), how often they make purchases (frequency), and how much they spend (monetary value). This can help businesses identify high-value customer segments.
**Psychographic Segmentation**
This is a method of dividing a market into segments based on variables such as social tag, lifestyle characteristics, attitudes, and interests. It goes beyond basic demographics to help businesses understand the psychological aspects that motivate consumer behavior.
