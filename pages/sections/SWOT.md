## 📖 Description
The SWOT analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the company’s current strategic position by identifying its internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as external opportunities and threats. Key strengths may include a strong brand reputation, innovative technology, or a highly skilled workforce. Conversely, weaknesses might involve limited market presence, high operational costs, or dependency on key suppliers. The goal of this analysis is to capitalize on strengths while addressing and mitigating weaknesses.

On the external side, the opportunities identified could range from emerging market trends and new customer segments to potential strategic partnerships. Threats may include increased competition, regulatory challenges, or economic downturns. This section helps to develop a strategic plan that leverages strengths to seize opportunities while creating defensive strategies to protect against potential threats, ensuring the business remains resilient and adaptable in a dynamic market environment.
In the context of business design, storytelling can take many forms.

- [[Brand Storytelling Framework]]
  - This tool helps businesses to craft a compelling narrative that communicates their brand's purpose, values, and mission. It includes elements such as the brand's history, vision, mission, values, personality, and customer promise. The framework guides businesses in telling their story in a way that resonates with their target audience and differentiates them from their competitors.

- [[Hero's Journey]]
  - The Hero's Journey, or the Monomyth, is a narrative pattern identified by Joseph Campbell that appears in drama, storytelling, myth, religious ritual, and psychological development. It describes the typical adventure of the archetype known as The Hero, the person who goes out and achieves great deeds on behalf of the group, tribe, or civilization. Businesses can use this pattern to structure their brand storytelling, positioning their customers as the heroes and themselves as the guides.

- [[StoryBrand Framework]]
  - Developed by Donald Miller, the StoryBrand Framework is a 7-part storytelling tool that helps businesses clarify their brand message. It guides businesses in creating a story where the customer is the hero, the business is the guide, and the product or service is the tool that helps the hero overcome their problem and achieve their goal.

- [[Transmedia Storytelling]]
  - This approach involves creating and sharing a narrative across multiple platforms and formats, using the benefits of each to enhance the overall storytelling. It allows businesses to engage with their audience in a variety of ways and to communicate their brand's purpose, values, and mission in a more immersive and interactive manner.

- [[Narrative Transportation Theory]]
  - This theory suggests that when people lose themselves in a story, their attitudes and intentions change to reflect that story. Businesses can use this theory to create compelling brand stories that 'transport' their audience and influence their perceptions and behaviors.

- [[Emotional Branding]]
  - Developed by Marc Gobé, this approach focuses on building brands that appeal directly to a consumer's emotional state, needs and aspirations. Emotional branding involves creating a story that will resonate with target customers on an emotional level, helping to build strong and lasting relationships.
