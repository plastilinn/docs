## 📖 Description
The concept of "Project Plan" in business modeling refers to a detailed plan that outlines the tasks, resources, timeline, and budget required to complete a specific project. This project is a temporary endeavor with a specific goal or objective that contributes to the overall business model. 

A project plan is a critical tool in business design and modeling as it provides a roadmap for executing and controlling the project. It helps to ensure that all team members understand their roles and responsibilities, the project's scope, and the timeline for completion. 

The process of creating a project plan involves several steps. First, the project's objectives and deliverables must be clearly defined. This includes understanding the project's purpose, its expected outcomes, and how it will contribute to the business model.

Next, the tasks required to achieve these objectives and deliverables must be identified. This includes determining what work needs to be done, who will do it, and when it needs to be completed. 

Then, the resources needed to complete these tasks must be identified and allocated. This includes personnel, equipment, materials, and budget. 

Finally, a timeline for the project must be developed. This includes setting start and end dates for the project, as well as deadlines for individual tasks. 

The project plan also includes a risk management plan, which identifies potential risks and outlines strategies for mitigating them. 

In conclusion, a project plan is a comprehensive guide for managing a project. It outlines the project's objectives, tasks, resources, timeline, and risk management strategies. It is a critical tool in business design and modeling, helping to ensure that projects are completed on time, within budget, and meet their objectives.

## 🧰 Tools
**Gantt Chart**
A Gantt chart is a visual representation of a project schedule, showing the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. It is a useful tool for planning and scheduling projects, managing the project's timeline, and visualizing the project plan in the context of the overall business model.
**Critical Path Method (CPM)**
CPM is a step-by-step project management technique for process planning that defines critical and non-critical tasks with the goal of preventing time-frame problems and process bottlenecks. It contributes to the project plan component of the business model by identifying the most critical tasks that directly impact the project timeline.
**Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)**
PERT is a method to analyze the involved tasks in completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and identifying the minimum time needed to complete the total project. It helps in creating a realistic project plan and schedule.
**Agile Project Management**
Agile project management is an iterative approach to delivering a project throughout its life cycle. It is a flexible and interactive method that allows changes and adjustments to be made to the project plan as it progresses, ensuring that the project remains aligned with the overall business model.
**Waterfall Model**
The Waterfall Model is a sequential design process, used in project management, where progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation, and maintenance. It provides a structured approach to project planning and execution.
**PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments)**
PRINCE2 is a process-based method for effective project management. It provides a structured project management method and promotes project-based management disciplines. It is a project management methodology that aligns with the project plan component of the business model.
**Scrum**
Scrum is an agile framework for managing knowledge work, with an emphasis on software development. It is designed for teams of three to nine members, who break their work into actions that can be completed within time-boxed iterations. It allows for flexibility and adaptability in project planning, making it a valuable tool for the project plan component of the business model.
