## 📖 Description
The concept of Functions in business modeling refers to the identification and specification of the roles and responsibilities that a person, a team member, can perform. This is based on their capacity, skills, and experience to successfully carry out these functions. These functions can range from strategic decision-making and management tasks to operational activities and customer service roles. 

The purpose of the Functions model is to clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities within a business, ensuring that every function is covered by a competent person. This helps to avoid confusion, overlaps, and gaps in responsibilities, which can lead to inefficiencies and errors. It also enables the business to leverage the strengths and expertise of its stakeholders, by assigning them functions that they are best suited to perform.

For example, in a software development company, a person might be assigned functions such as 'Code Development', 'Code Review', and 'Bug Fixing'. Another person might be assigned functions such as 'Project Management', 'Resource Allocation', and 'Performance Evaluation'. 

In essence, the Functions model is a critical aspect of business design. It helps to structure the business, optimize its operations, and ensure that every stakeholder is contributing effectively to its success. It also provides a foundation for other business modeling concepts, such as process mapping and workflow design, by defining who does what in the business.
