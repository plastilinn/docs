## 📖 Description
The concept of "Roadmap" in business modeling is a strategic plan that outlines the steps and strategies needed to implement a business model solution. This roadmap serves as a guide for businesses to navigate their way from their current state to their desired future state. It is a critical tool for managing change, driving alignment, and facilitating decision-making within a business.

Here are the key aspects of "Roadmap" in business modeling:

- Vision: This is the desired future state of the business. The vision should be clear, compelling, and aligned with the business's strategic objectives. For example, a retail business might envision becoming the leading provider of sustainable fashion in its market.

- Steps: These are the specific actions that the business needs to take to move from its current state to its desired future state. The steps should be practical, measurable, and aligned with the business's resources and capabilities. For example, the retail business might need to source sustainable materials, design eco-friendly products, and develop green manufacturing processes.

- Strategies: These are the approaches that the business will use to execute the steps. The strategies should be effective, flexible, and aligned with the business's competitive environment. For example, the retail business might use a combination of partnerships, acquisitions, and organic growth to achieve its vision.

- Milestones: These are the key achievements that the business aims to reach along its journey. The milestones should be significant, achievable, and aligned with the business's timeline. For example, the retail business might aim to launch its first sustainable product line within one year.

By developing a "Roadmap", a business can ensure that it is moving in the right direction, making progress towards its vision, and creating value for its stakeholders. For instance, the retail business might use its roadmap to guide its transition to sustainable fashion, track its progress, and communicate its achievements to its customers, employees, and investors. This would demonstrate the business's ability to leverage its "Roadmap" to drive its business model and create value.

## 🔑 Keys



## 🧰 Tools
**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, the "Key Activities" component can be used to outline the steps and strategies needed to implement a business model solution. This includes the most important actions a company must take to operate successfully, such as production, problem-solving, and training.
**Lean Startup Methodology**
The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, emphasizes the creation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and then using customer feedback to iterate and improve. The roadmap in this context is a plan for developing and refining the solution based on customer feedback.
**Agile Development**
Agile development is a methodology that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change. The roadmap in Agile development is a high-level view of the product’s development, outlining the steps and strategies needed to implement the solution.
**Gantt Chart**
A Gantt chart is a visual representation of a project schedule, showing the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. It can be used as a roadmap to outline the steps and strategies needed to implement a business model solution.
**SWOT Analysis**
A SWOT analysis can be used to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to a business model solution. This can help in the creation of a roadmap by identifying potential challenges and opportunities that may arise during the implementation of the solution.
**PESTEL Analysis**
A PESTEL analysis can be used to identify how external macro-environmental factors might affect the implementation of a business model solution. This can help in the creation of a roadmap by providing insights into potential challenges and opportunities that may arise from political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal factors.
