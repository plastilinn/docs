## üìñ Description
The concept of "Experiment List" in business modeling refers to a systematic list of tests or trials designed to validate the assumptions and hypotheses about a business model's value proposition, customer segments, and revenue streams. This list is used as a roadmap to test and validate the viability and effectiveness of a business model before its full-scale implementation.

An experiment list can include various types of tests depending on the specific aspects of the business model that need validation. For instance, it may include customer interviews to validate assumptions about customer needs and preferences. It may also include prototype testing to validate the feasibility and attractiveness of a product or service offering.

Moreover, an experiment list can also include market tests to validate assumptions about the size and profitability of a market segment. It may also include financial tests to validate assumptions about revenue streams and cost structures.

The experiment list serves as a structured approach to risk management in business design and modeling. It helps business leaders and stakeholders to identify and address potential flaws and weaknesses in a business model before they become costly mistakes. It also provides valuable insights and learnings that can be used to refine and improve the business model.

In conclusion, an experiment list is a critical tool in business design and modeling. It provides a systematic and evidence-based approach to validating the key assumptions and hypotheses of a business model, reducing risks and increasing the chances of success. It is a crucial component of a lean and agile business model, promoting continuous learning and adaptation in response to market feedback and changes.

## üëâ Example (SpaceX)

üß™#experiment Reusable Rocket Test

Assumption: Cost reduction through reusable rockets will significantly lower launch costs.

Experiment: Conduct rapid, repeated launches with reusable rockets (e.g., Falcon 9) in a short timeframe to assess wear, repair costs, and operational efficiency compared to traditional rockets.

Metric: Cost per launch and turnaround time for the next flight.

üß™#experiment Market Demand Validation for Commercial Space Services

Assumption: There is Demand for commercial space services that is growing and sustained.

Experiment: Launch a pre-sale campaign or survey potential clients (e.g., satellite companies) to measure interest in launch services and track how many requests for quotes are received.

Metric: Number of quote requests and early reservations.

üß™#experiment Crewed Mission Safety Simulation

Risk: Safety and Crewed Missions require robust systems for frequent human spaceflights.

Experiment: Conduct in-flight abort and atmospheric re-entry simulations with the Crew Dragon capsule, testing the safety of emergency systems in different critical scenarios.

Metric: Success rate of safe aborts and performance of emergency systems.

## üóÑÔ∏è Topics


## üß∞ Tools
- [[Lean Startup Methodology]]
  - The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, emphasizes the importance of conducting experiments to validate business assumptions. The methodology encourages businesses to create a "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) and use it to test key business hypotheses. The feedback received from these experiments is then used to iterate and improve the business model.
- [[Design Thinking]]
  - Design Thinking is a problem-solving approach that involves empathizing with users, defining problems, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing. The testing phase often involves conducting experiments to validate the solutions developed during the ideation phase. These experiments can provide valuable insights into the value proposition, customer segments, and revenue streams of a business model.
- [[Business Model Canvas]]
  - The Business Model Canvas, developed by Alexander Osterwalder, includes a component called "channels" which can be used to design and conduct experiments. These experiments can test assumptions about how a company communicates and delivers its value proposition to its customer segments.
- [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
  - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is designed to help businesses understand their customers' needs and create products and services that meet those needs. It encourages businesses to conduct experiments to validate their assumptions about their value proposition and customer segments.
- [[Pivot or Persevere]]
  - This is a decision-making process used in the Lean Startup methodology. After conducting experiments, businesses use the results to decide whether to pivot (make a fundamental change to the business model) or persevere (keep improving the current model). This process is crucial for validating a business model's value proposition, customer segments, and revenue streams.
- [[Growth Hacking]]
  - Growth Hacking is a marketing strategy that focuses on rapid experimentation across marketing channels and product development to identify the most effective ways to grow a business. These experiments can provide valuable insights into a business model's value proposition, customer segments, and revenue streams.
