## 📖 Description
The concept of a Risk List in business modeling refers to the identification and documentation of potential negative outcomes or uncertainties that may affect the success and sustainability of a business model. This concept is rooted in the understanding that every business operates in an environment of uncertainty and risk, and that proactive risk management is crucial for business survival and growth.

In the context of business design, a Risk List can take many forms. It could be a list of potential market risks such as changes in customer preferences, competitive threats, or regulatory changes. It could also include operational risks such as supply chain disruptions, technology failures, or talent shortages. Financial risks such as currency fluctuations, interest rate changes, or liquidity issues may also be included. 

The Risk List serves several key functions in business modeling. Firstly, it helps to identify and prioritize risks, enabling businesses to focus their resources and efforts on the most significant threats. By understanding the potential impact and likelihood of each risk, businesses can make informed decisions about risk mitigation strategies.

Secondly, a Risk List can facilitate proactive risk management. By identifying potential risks early, businesses can take steps to prevent or reduce their impact, rather than reacting to them after they occur. This can enhance business resilience, reduce costs, and protect business value.

Thirdly, a Risk List can enhance strategic planning and decision-making. By considering potential risks in their strategic planning, businesses can develop more robust and resilient strategies that take into account the full range of uncertainties they face.

Lastly, a Risk List can improve stakeholder communication and trust. By transparently communicating about potential risks and their management strategies, businesses can build trust with stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, and regulators.

In summary, the Risk List model in business design is a strategic approach that involves identifying, documenting, and managing potential negative outcomes or uncertainties that may affect the success and sustainability of a business model. It is a crucial tool for enhancing business resilience, strategic planning, stakeholder communication, and overall business performance.

## 👉 Examples

🚨#risk Technical Challenges

Developing and operating advanced rocket technology is inherently complex and carries technical risks. Space X must overcome challenges related to propulsion systems, reusability, landing accuracy, and payload integration.

🚨#risk Launch Failures

Launching rockets into space is a high-stakes endeavor, and failures can occur. Space X faces the risk of launch failures that can result in the loss of payloads and damage their reputation.

🚨#risk Regulatory and Compliance

Operating in the space industry requires compliance with various regulations and governmental approvals. Compliance challenges or delays can impact their ability to conduct launches and generate revenue.

🚨#risk Safety and Crewed Missions

Ensuring the reliability and safety of crewed spacecraft, conducting rigorous testing, and managing risks associated with human spaceflight are critical concerns for Space X.

🚨#risk Financial Viability

Space X faces financial risks, including securing adequate funding, managing costs, profitability challenges, and potential economic downturns that may affect demand for space services.

## 🧰 Tools
- [[Risk Management Plan]]
  - A Risk Management Plan is a document that a project manager prepares to foresee risks, estimate impacts, and define responses to issues. It also contains a risk assessment matrix. A risk is "an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives." This tool is used to identify potential risks in the early stages of a project and is a part of the overall project management plan.
- [[SWOT Analysis]]
  - The SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a strategic planning tool used to identify and analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats involved in a project or business. It can be used to identify potential risks (threats) that could negatively affect the business model.
- [[PESTEL Analysis]]
  - The PESTEL Analysis (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal) is a framework or tool used by marketers to analyze and monitor the macro-environmental factors that have an impact on an organization. By understanding these external environments, businesses can maximize the opportunities and minimize the threats to the organization.
- [[Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)]]
  - The Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) is a hierarchical representation of risks according to their risk categories. This tool is used in risk management to help identify and manage potential risks associated with a project or business.
- [[Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)]]
  - Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a step-by-step approach for identifying all possible failures in a design, a manufacturing or assembly process, or a product or service. It is a common tool for risk assessment and is used to identify potential failure modes, determine their effect on the operation of the product, and identify actions to mitigate the failures.
- [[Monte Carlo Simulation]]
  - Monte Carlo Simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that allows people to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making. It provides a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action. It shows the extreme possibilities—the outcomes of going for broke and for the most conservative decision—along with all possible consequences for middle-of-the-road decisions.
