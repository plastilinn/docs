## üìñ Description
The concept of "relationship" in business modeling refers to the identification and characterization of the relationships a company maintains with its stakeholders, which can be personal, automated, self-service, among others. These relationships are established and managed based on the specific profile or identity of each stakeholder.

The profile of a stakeholder can be defined by various factors such as their role, interests, influence, and interaction with the company. The relationship, on the other hand, refers to the nature and extent of the company's engagement with the stakeholder. This can range from personal interactions, such as face-to-face meetings or phone calls, to automated interactions, such as email newsletters or mobile app notifications. Self-service interactions, such as using a website or app to make purchases or access services, are also part of this concept.

For example, a company might identify a profile of customers who prefer online shopping. The relationship with this profile could be largely automated, with the company using email marketing, personalized product recommendations, and a user-friendly e-commerce platform to engage with these customers. The goal would be to enhance the online shopping experience, increase customer satisfaction, and ultimately, boost online sales.

In essence, the concept of "relationship" in business modeling is about understanding who a company's stakeholders are, how they prefer to interact with the company, and managing these relationships effectively to meet both the stakeholders' needs and the company's objectives. This is a crucial aspect of business design, as it informs the development of a company's customer engagement strategies, communication channels, and service delivery methods.
