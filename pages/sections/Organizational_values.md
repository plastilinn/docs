## 📖 Description
the concept of "organization values" refers to the core principles or standards that guide a company's actions and decisions. These values are deeply ingrained in the company's culture and serve as a compass for its behavior, shaping its interactions with stakeholders, its approach to business, and its overall identity.

Organization values are a critical component of a business model because they define what the company stands for and what it believes in. They influence every aspect of the business, from its mission and vision to its strategies and operations. They also play a key role in attracting and retaining employees, customers, and partners who share the same values.

For example, a company might have organization values centered around innovation, customer satisfaction, and social responsibility. These values would guide the company's actions and decisions, leading it to invest in research and development, prioritize customer needs, and engage in sustainable practices.

In essence, the concept of "organization values" in business modeling is about defining and embodying the principles that drive a company's actions and decisions. It is a fundamental element in business design, shaping the company's culture, strategy, and brand identity. It influences how the company is perceived by its stakeholders and how it contributes to society at large.

- [[Corporate Culture Health Check]]
  - This tool, developed by Denison Consulting, assesses the alignment of an organization's values with its practices. It measures four key traits: adaptability, mission, involvement, and consistency. The latter directly relates to the organization's values, as it measures the extent to which the organization's behavior is consistent with its stated values.

- [[Balanced Scorecard]]
  - The Balanced Scorecard, developed by Robert Kaplan and David Norton, is a strategic planning and management system that organizations use to align business activities with the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organization performance against strategic goals. The scorecard includes financial measures that tell the results of actions already taken. And it complements the financial measures with operational measures on customer satisfaction, internal processes, and the organization's innovation and improvement activities—operational measures that are the drivers of future financial performance.

- [[Cultural Web]]
  - The Cultural Web, developed by Gerry Johnson and Kevan Scholes, is a model that represents the behavioral, physical, and symbolic manifestations of a culture that can help to identify the organization's culture. One of the six components of the Cultural Web is 'Rituals and Routines', which are the daily behavior and actions of people that signal acceptable behavior. This influences what is expected to happen in given situations, and what is valued by management.

- [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
  - The Value Proposition Canvas, developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is a tool that helps organizations ensure that their products or services are positioned around what the customer values and needs. The 'Customer Profile' section of the canvas helps organizations to understand customer needs and whether the organization's values align with these needs.

- [[McKinsey 7S Framework]]
  - The McKinsey 7S Framework, developed by Tom Peters and Robert Waterman at McKinsey & Company, is a model that analyzes seven key elements of an organization to determine how well they are aligned and how they can be improved. One of these elements is 'Shared Values', which are the core values of the company that are reflected in the corporate culture and general work ethic.
