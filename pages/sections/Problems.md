## 📖 Description
The concept of "Problems" in business modeling refers to problems that your target customer faces in relation to your product or service. Focus on issues that are significant and frequent enough to motivate potential customers to seek a solution. These problems should be specific, actionable, and directly tied to the value your product aims to deliver. Avoid generic statements, and instead, use clear, concise descriptions based on customer research or insights.  The aim is to create a comprehensive understanding of each profile, which can then be used to tailor products, services, and marketing efforts to achieve the set goals.

The "Problems" section is where you clearly define the key challenges, pain points, or needs of your target customers. It focuses on identifying the top three problems they face and understanding their current solutions or workarounds. This section sets the foundation for designing a solution that effectively addresses these issues. List the most significant problems or frustrations your target customers face. These should be specific and relevant to the audience you're focusing on. Identify how customers are currently solving these problems. This could include competitor products, manual processes, or makeshift solutions. Highlight inefficiencies or limitations in these existing alternatives to showcase the opportunity for your solution.

Gather insights from customer interviews, surveys, or research to ensure the problems are real and significant. Avoid assumptions and validate the issues with actual data from your target audience. Ensure the problems are tied to a specific customer segment. This focus helps tailor your solution and business model to their unique needs. By thoroughly understanding and defining the problems in this section, you establish the basis for your Unique Value Proposition and Solution sections. Solving a well-identified problem is the key to building a product or service that resonates with your customers and succeeds in the market.

## 👉 Example (SpaceX)

😟#problem I need to launch a satellite into orbit #pain  

I need to get my satellite into orbit because my services depend on it. If there are delays in the launch, my operations and service delivery will be disrupted.

😟#problem I have a limited budget #pain  

I’m working with a tight budget and need an affordable launch solution that doesn’t compromise on quality or reliability.

😟#problem I want to minimize risks during the satellite deployment #gain  

I’m very cautious about the risks involved. A failed launch would not only be costly but could also harm my business reputation.

😟#problem I have strict deadlines for my satellite to be functional #pain  

My satellite must be operational by a specific date for a time-sensitive project. Any delay would result in missed opportunities, client dissatisfaction, or even penalties.

😟#problem Coordinating the satellite launch is too complex #pain  

I find it overwhelming to manage the coordination between satellite manufacturers, launch providers, and ground control teams. Any miscommunication could cause delays or technical issues.

😟#problem I’m struggling to find a reliable launch provider #pain  

I’m having a hard time identifying a launch provider that’s both reliable and compatible with my satellite’s needs.

😟#problem I’m concerned about the safety and security of my satellite #pain  

I need to make sure my satellite stays secure and undamaged during transportation and launch. Any issues here could jeopardize the entire mission.

😟#problem I worry about last-minute technical changes #pain  

Dealing with unexpected technical adjustments close to the launch date is stressful and can throw off my timeline and budget.

😟#problem I need clearer pricing and service details #pain  

It’s frustrating that many launch providers don’t offer transparent pricing or clear details about their services. This makes it hard to compare options.

😟#problem I need strong post-launch support #gain  

I want a provider who doesn’t just launch my satellite but also ensures it works perfectly afterward and can address any problems quickly.

- [[Business Model Canvas]]
  - In the Business Model Canvas, the "Customer Segments" component can be used to identify and understand the problems, needs, or desires of different stakeholder groups. This understanding can then be used to shape the company's value proposition and overall business strategy.
- [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
  - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is designed to help businesses understand their customers' needs and wants in a more detailed way. The "Customer Profile" section of the canvas includes three components: customer jobs (what customers are trying to get done in their lives), pains (the problems and challenges related to these jobs), and gains (the benefits customers hope to achieve).
- [[SMART Goals]]
  - SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) Goals are a tool for setting and achieving goals. This tool can be used to define the goals of stakeholders in a clear and actionable way, which can then inform the design of the business model.
- [[Stakeholder Analysis]]
  - This tool is used to identify and understand the interests, goals, and power of a business's stakeholders. This understanding can then be used to shape the business model and strategy.
- [[SWOT Analysis]]
  - The SWOT analysis can be used to understand the problems, needs, and desires of stakeholders. For example, weaknesses might represent problems that stakeholders are facing, while opportunities might represent unmet needs or desires.
- [[PESTEL Analysis]]
  - The PESTEL analysis can be used to understand the broader context in which stakeholders are operating. This can help to identify their problems, needs, and desires. For example, social factors might influence the needs and desires of customers, while technological factors might create new opportunities to meet these needs.
