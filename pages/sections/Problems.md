## 📖 Description
The concept of "profile/goals" in business modeling refers to the identification and characterization of individual or group profiles within a company's market, and aligning them with specific goals. These profiles are created based on a variety of factors, such as demographic details, buying behaviors, needs, preferences, lifestyle characteristics, and more. The associated goals are then set in accordance with these profiles to ensure that the company's offerings meet the specific needs and preferences of each group.

The goals associated with each profile can be diverse, ranging from increasing customer satisfaction, boosting sales, improving product quality, to enhancing brand awareness. The aim is to create a comprehensive understanding of each profile, which can then be used to tailor products, services, and marketing efforts to achieve the set goals.

For instance, a clothing retailer might identify a profile of customers who are fashion-forward and prefer high-end brands. The goals for this profile might include increasing brand loyalty, boosting sales of premium products, and enhancing the company's reputation as a luxury retailer. The retailer would then develop products and marketing strategies specifically targeted at this group to achieve these goals.

In essence, the concept of "profile/goals" in business modeling is about creating detailed portraits of each customer group or individual, based on shared characteristics and behaviors, and aligning them with specific business goals. This allows a company to better understand its customers and tailor its offerings and marketing efforts accordingly, leading to improved customer satisfaction and business performance. It is a key component of business design, informing the development of a company's products, services, and marketing strategies.

## 👉 Example (SpaceX)

😟#problem Need to launch a satellite into orbit

The services I offer to my customers rely heavily on satellite technology. I have a satellite that needs to be deployed soon to meet operational goals. Delays in launching could lead to disruptions in service delivery.

😟#problem Limited budget

I have a set financial limit for launching the satellite, and I need a cost-effective solution that doesn’t exceed my budget. This means I must balance quality and reliability with affordability when selecting a launch service.

😟#problem Risk-averse approach to satellite deployment

I want to minimize risks during the satellite launch and ensure the satellite reaches its intended orbit without issues. A failed launch would be costly and could harm my business operations or reputation.

😟#problem Strict deadlines for satellite functionality

The satellite must be operational by a specific date, as it is part of a time-sensitive project. Delays in the launch or deployment could result in missed opportunities, fines, or client dissatisfaction.

😟#problem Satellite Launch Coordination Complexity

Coordinating the satellite launch with various stakeholders, such as satellite manufacturers, launch providers, and ground control teams, can be complex. Any misalignment in timing or communication could lead to delays or technical issues.
