## 📖 Description
The concept of a **stakeholder** in the context of business and business modeling refers to any person, group, or entity that has an interest in or can be affected by the activities, decisions, and objectives of a company. Stakeholders can be internal or external to the organization, and their degree of influence varies according to their relationship and role in the business.

Common types of stakeholders in business modeling include:

**External Stakeholders**:
   - **Customers**: Users or buyers of the product or service, whose satisfaction and loyalty are fundamental to the business.
   - **Suppliers**: Companies or individuals who provide materials, goods, or services to the business, affecting the supply chain.
   - **Investors**: Entities or individuals who provide funding and expect returns on their investments.
   - **Community and Society in General**: The company may have an impact on the local community or society, be it environmental, economic, or social.
   - **Government and Regulatory Entities**: Establish and monitor compliance with laws and regulations applicable to the business's activities.

**Internal Stakeholders**:
   - **Owners and Shareholders**: Individuals who hold a stake in the company and are interested in its profitability and growth.
   - **Employees and Management**: People working directly within the company whose motivation, security, and professional development are impacted by business decisions.

When designing or modeling a business, it's crucial to identify stakeholders and understand their needs, expectations, and influence. Each stakeholder group can impact the development of the company's strategy and results. In models like the **Business Model Canvas**, stakeholders are considered in elements such as *key partners* (suppliers and strategic allies) and *customer segments*.

Stakeholder management involves analyzing the level of interest and influence of each stakeholder and developing strategies to align the business objectives with their expectations, ensuring that the interactions and mutual impact are positive.
