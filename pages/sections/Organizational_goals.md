## 📖 Description
"Organizational goals" refer to the strategic objectives that a company aims to achieve over a specific period. These goals provide direction, facilitate planning, guide decision-making, and serve as a benchmark for evaluating performance. They are a critical component of a business model as they define the company's purpose, drive its activities, and shape its strategies.

Organization goals typically encompass the following aspects:

- Financial Goals: These relate to the financial outcomes that the company seeks to achieve, such as revenue growth, profit margin improvement, cost reduction, and return on investment. They reflect the company's financial aspirations and its commitment to delivering value to shareholders.
- Operational Goals: These pertain to the operational results that the company aims to attain, such as enhancing productivity, improving quality, increasing efficiency, and boosting customer satisfaction. They demonstrate the company's focus on operational excellence and process optimization.
- Market Goals: These involve the market positions that the company strives to reach, such as gaining market share, entering new markets, strengthening competitive position, and building brand reputation. They indicate the company's ambition to grow, compete, and succeed in the marketplace.
- Organizational Goals: These include the organizational outcomes that the company desires to realize, such as developing leadership, fostering innovation, promoting a positive culture, and enhancing employee engagement. They signify the company's dedication to creating a conducive work environment, nurturing talent, and fostering organizational health.

For instance, an organization's goals might include increasing revenue by 20%, reducing operational costs by 10%, expanding to two new markets, and improving employee engagement by 15%. These goals would guide the company's strategies, decisions, and actions, and provide a standard for measuring its performance. If the company achieves these goals, it would indicate that it is successful in executing its business model and creating value. Conversely, if the company falls short of these goals, it would suggest that it needs to reassess its business model, strategies, or execution.

## 🧰 Tools
**Balanced Scorecard**
The Balanced Scorecard, developed by Robert Kaplan and David Norton, is a strategic planning and management system used extensively in business and industry, government, and nonprofit organizations worldwide to align business activities to the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organization performance against strategic goals. It provides a framework that not only provides performance measurements, but helps planners identify what should be done and measured.
  
**OKR (Objectives and Key Results)**
OKR is a goal-setting framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes. The main goal of OKR is to define company and team "objectives" along with the measurable "key results" that define achievement of each objective. The goal of OKR is to ensure that everyone is moving in the same direction, with clear priorities, at a constant pace, channeling efforts, assuring coordination and connecting different areas.

**SMART Goals**
SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. When setting goals, these factors are considered to ensure that the goals are clear and reachable. Each SMART goal you create is a tool that helps to focus your efforts and increase the chances of achieving your goal.

**KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**
KPIs are a type of performance measurement that evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity in which it engages. They help to understand if the organization is headed in the right direction and if it is achieving its business goals.

**SWOT Analysis**
While SWOT Analysis is a general tool, it can be used to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to business competition or project planning. It is intended to specify the objectives of the business venture or project and identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving those objectives. 

**PESTEL Analysis**
PESTEL Analysis is a framework or tool used by marketers to analyze and monitor the macro-environmental (external marketing environment) factors that have an impact on an organization. The outcome of PESTEL Analysis can be used to adjust the strategy or identify new goals for the organization.
